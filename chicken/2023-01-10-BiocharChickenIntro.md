**About**: This paper is about the benefits of biochar in managing your backyard chicken coops or your chicken houses if you are a producer.

## Introduction
Biochar has been known to the ancient world in the Amazonia and agricultural practices of South America. This provided a base for agriculture and natural growth encountered by the Europeans in these parts of Amazon and South America. The technical definition, per Lehmann and Joseph is the following: *biochar is the carbon-rich product obtained when biomass, such as wood, manure or leaves, is heated in a closed container with little or no available air.* Visit our site for details on [biochar introduction]().

## Some Challenges in Poultry Management
Poultry business, be it a backyard coop to supply meat and eggs for the family or few dozen chicken houses managed by veteran producers, are plagued with similar problems, albeit at different scales.

The handling of the litter is the first big issue. Poultry litter is known to release pollutants with ammonia which reduces air and water quality, along with carrying a heavy microbial load [2]. The odor can affect the bird health along with human working conditions. In addition, this odor which is primarily ammonia, is what is needed later for fertilizing the soil, which is lost to atomosphere. Hence the odor problem is dual natured - both smell and the loss of the valuable compound.

Moisture and wetness in the substrate or beddding for the birds is known to cause various diseases. This coupled with temperature control issues is a hotbed for various pathogens which affect the bird health and can be terminal, in various cases. One of the producers we know is experimenting with wood based heat instead of propane to control moisture in the bedding and litter.

With rising feed costs and the lack of grazing options in large scale operations, the feed bills and hence the price of egg and meat have increased. As many producers, hobby farmers and homesteaders, are getting budget conscious, we need a way to ensure the feed provided is fully improving the bird health. Even if you have the best feed, all birds eat off the bedding and litter, hence having a strategy to ensure the intake can be managed for optimum bird health is another major concern.

## Using biochar for effective poultry management
Biochar has a porous structure along with a large surface area at the molecular structural level, which provides the ideal exchange ground for chemistry and biology. From nutrients to gases to metallic ions to micro-organisms, the surface area and structure makes it possible for not just adsorption of the particulates on biochar surface but also retention and recall in the system.

This is the key to the various properties of biochar we will describe for use in poultry to address the issues raised in the previous section.

#### Odor Control
Per [2] its shown that Biochar will cause N (Nitrogen) and P (Phosphorus) to be retained, which results in less odor, which indicates that N was adsorbed from the ammonia (NH3) from te litter. Per [4] biochar with poultry litter acts as bulking agent and reduces ammonia volatization and carbon dioxide emissions.

#### Toxin Control
In [6] they showed application of biochar, to reduce pathogens in the litter and combined with the research in [2,4] we have seen that the pathogen activity is reduced when biochar is mixed with litter as part of the bedding.

#### Moisture Control
Research in [3] showed that poultry litter with biochar bedding mixed improved the dry matter of the litter. Biochar is known to have water adsorption properties from other soil related researches and this combined with the work on Maize yield in [3] confirms the same effect on poultry litter.

#### Digestive Catalyst
Research in [6] suggests a 2% addition of fine biochar in their work, improved digestion, immunity and reduced pathogen load. They also identified this pathon load reduction included Campylobacter Hepaticus (which causes Spotty Liver Disease)

#### Charged Compost Production
From the research in [3,4] we see that the TN (Total Nitrogen) ad TC (Total Carbon) retained was improved in the soil when biochar mixed poultry litter was applied to two test crops. The maize yield in [3] showed upto 42% increase in biomass (production of maize and stock), while the N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activity (proxy for nutrient availability in the soil by biomass decomposition) was increased by 50%. Application to the paddy fields in [4] showed similar increases.

## Conclusion
In summary, we can view the above information in a schematic as follows.

In addition to the peer-reviewed research cited, we have several local studies done in the larger Ozarks area and have created specific recipes for adding biochar for your chicken houses. We also have guidelines on how to balance biochar in bedding, timing of it based on when your birds come in, litter depth as well as mixing in the feed. Note, that by having it in the bedding and litter the birds will intake as they scratch and peck, therefore, if trying to employ the complete program, specific guidelines needs to be followed.

## Followup
For the backyard chicken coop, we sell in 5, 10, 20 gal bags. For larger chicken producers we sell in 1-3 cubic yard totes as well bulk delivery.

If you are interested to know how to use biochar in your poultry business or if you are new to chicken and getting started with your backyard coop and want to have it smell free to keep unfriendly looks from your neighbors, then contact us in one of the ways.
