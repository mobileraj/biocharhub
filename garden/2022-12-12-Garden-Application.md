If you want to augment soil or your ground soil, best recommendation from research is one of the following:

1. Spread the biochar on the ground at the end of fall season after harvest and clearing and cover the biochar and ground with wood chips. This is the method used by no-till and regenerative farmers that has seen results. You can plant in spring in the ground, either seed or starters, through the biochar and decomposing wood chips. This is the ideal recommendation if you have the right timing and can wait for a few months for the biochar to set in soil.
2. For smaller areas and needing immediate planting, mix in the biochar with the soil if you are able to, or spread it like the ground prep step above (#1), plant the starters (seeds are NOT recommended in this method), in the ground through the biochar and cover with wood chips or mulch or other ground cover.
3. For raised beds and boxed garden beds, mix in 5-10% biochar with potting soil or garden soil mix, adding compost as needed and available, plant your seedlings or starters and cover with mulch or wood chips. You can also follow **charging** methods in section below.
4. For seeds, start with a smaller container to get them started using the starter method of your choice with planting soil or seed starting soil from stores. Once you have seedlings or starters with roots, you can transplant them to raised bed or ground that is prepared (like #1,2 or 3). Research on this is still divided. We have few empirical evidence of the seeds not being affected by fresh biochar when planted,
but mainstream research at this point is divided and therefore needs further study. We are cautioning against planting seeds directly in soil with fresh biochar (as in it hasn't had time like in #1). If the biochar has been mixed with soil or on ground for more than few months, as we have noted, the seeds can be planted. But for immediate use of biochar on soil, we caution planting seeds directly. For more on this, please visit https://biochar.tejasbuds.com to read about ongoing work.
5. For advanced applications, you can treat the biochar with compost tea, other liquids like Growers Mineral Solution or fish emulsion with the application being sparse, so the biochar is not drowning in the liquid, and then use this treated biochar. We will be doing more research on these treated biochar varieties on growing and gardening in general and will be posting on our [Biochar Hub](https://tejasbuds.com/biocharhub), over time.

### Charging Biochar
Since biochar by itself is pure carbon, one way to activate the biochar for immediate use, when you acquire biochar from us (bag or totes) is to do one of the following:

- soak biochar in water in a trough or bucket, with your liquid fertilizer. Let it soak for no less than 3 days and you can apply the biochar.
- soak biochar in water mixed with your compost tea or from one of our suppliers. Let it soak for no less than 3 days.
- add biochar to your compost following your composting regiment and based on the type of compost material, you can use your charged biochar in 3 days to several weeks. If its chicken litter compost then it will be longer (atleast 2 weeks) compared to rabbit manure (will be 3 days). The composting regiment assumes you are adding water and turning, which will ensure charging process.

Once the biochar is charged it can be added to the soil on ground or with soil mix in a garden box. This mix can be top dressed to gardend and fields alike.
