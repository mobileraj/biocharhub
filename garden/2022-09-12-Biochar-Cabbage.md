**About**: This paper is about use of biochar in a backyard garden to produce various vegetables, featuring the cabbage.

## Typical Cabbage
Backyard gardeners and homesteaders wanting to grow their own produce cant afford the tricks and care of professional growers who might perform various treatments and constant care and tending to produce large amount or larger size of the vegetables. Neither are they, competing in the Guinness book of records to try to grow a basketball size cabbage.

Typical cabbages are 1-2 lbs and just over the size of couple baseball/softball. 

This writeup is the story from a backyard (its actually frontyard) garden from Versailles, MO, where larger size cabbages and other vegetables that are rich in taste are grown without really trying. This story focuses on cabbage, with other vegetables to come later.

## Setup
There are two major plots of focus for these writeups for the vegetables from Versailles. 

Plot1 is a repurposed front yard lawn which was a traditional garden for few seasons and was conditioned 3 winters ago, going through 4 springs, following the below method. 

Plot2 is also a repurposed front yard lawn, but was just a lawn and conditioned 2 winters ago following the below method.

The data for this story is from Plot1, although Plot2 has also seen similar results, which we will be writing about in future series.

The setup of the plots are as follows:

- mowing to reduce grass or clearing of the vegetations

- spread of cover crops in fall (this was unique to Plot1)

- along with layering of E3 Biochar through the plot. About 1/4-1/2 inch was the application

- followed by wood chips evenly across the predefined plot to provide weed barrier but enough to let the cover crops to come up

- no till or major mechanical soil disturbance other than surface tractor for spreading the biochar and human movements to layer in the woodchips

- no insecticide or herbicides or fertilizers applied.


This plot of no-till with biochar and woodchips sat through the winters and various vegetables were planted in spring. Tomatoes, beets, turnips, peas and cabbage.

The plot was only watered through rain and any other natural precipitation, and no well/city water.

This cabbage specimen was from this year Spring harvest from Plot1. There are still large cabbages of this size and smaller on the ground waiting to be harvested.


## Cabbage
This is a typical harvest of the cabbage crop and this one being on the above average side. This weighed 9.6lbs and measured just under 30in in diameter. The largest from this garden plot measured 18lbs.

As you can see for live compare, we used a typical baseball to show the difference.

The taste and the feel of the cabbage was good and fresh even after leaving it in room temperature for close to a week.
  

Our belief is that biochar has effected the soil structure over the few seasons in over the years it has been in the ground and helped with porosity, nutrient density and facilitating better nutrient transport. In addition, the initial cover crop provided acceleration to building of the soil structure and nutrient base needed for spring crop/vegetables. This has effected all crops positively, even when rain was scarce and warding off harmfuls and promoting beneficial insects.

To learn more about biochar and its effects, you can read more on our [Biochar page or blog](tejasbuds.com) and subscribe or bookmark for updates on these kinds of reports and stories.

## Looking ahead

God willing, we plan to do more experiments in controlled plots to show the difference of crops in the same field, where once is treated with biochar and the others are not. This will provide interesting data points for us to come up with actual recommendations for home gardeners and homesteaders alike. We also plan to do soil tests and publish results here as we build up our experiment plots.

We also want to bring in ancient practices that has been followed by several farmers who work with what the Most High has created not try to improve upon it. We will explore further use of the no-till method and understanding how forest floors produce such rich vegetations and looking at creative ways to use natural amendments to augment where the soil conditions might be challenging.

We believe that biochar can provide a catalyst and play a small part in taking us back to the land in how the Most High intended us to steward the land.

Godspeed & Onward!
